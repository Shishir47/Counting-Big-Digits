# Counting-Big-Digits-In-C
Count Digits of Number that has more than 10 digits.
We know with the codes available online, you can only count numbers upto 10 digits but with this code you can count bigger numbers in C. I did it with Do While loop but you can do it with only While loop just make sure you use "unsigned long long int" which has a format of "%llu" 

Thank you for your precious time. Hope it will help you.
